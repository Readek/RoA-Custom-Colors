# RoA-Custom-Colors

A web port of the Rivals of Aether Custom Colors screen, made to be as close as possible to the original material, while still making it responsive for different devices.

This project was made using only **vanilla JS**, and doesn't use any external library. Also uses **WebGL2** to recolor the images.
